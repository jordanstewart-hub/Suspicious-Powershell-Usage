## Threat Event (Encoded Powershell Execution)

## ðŸ‘£Steps the Bad Actor Took
## 1. Open a Command Prompt or Run Terminal with Admin Rights. Ensures elevated privileges for executing PowerShell commands if needed.
## 2. Execute PowerShell with an Encoded Command
Command used: powershell.exe -NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand UwB0AGEAcgB0AC0AUwBsAGUAZQBwACAAMQAwAA==
## 3. Deleted PowerShell history or cleared artifacts to evade detection.


## ðŸ’¡Explanation of the Parameters Used:

-NoProfile: Prevents PowerShell profiles from loading, making execution faster and stealthier.

-WindowStyle Hidden: Runs the process without opening a visible window â€” to stay unnoticed.

-EncodedCommand: Accepts a Base64-encoded string â€” typically used to obfuscate the command.
## What the Encoded Command Does
The Base64 string "UwB0AGEAcgB0AC0AUwBsAGUAZQBwACAAMQAwAA==" decodes to: Start-Sleep 10
This command makes the system pause for 10 seconds. It's harmless for simulation, but commonly used in real attacks as a placeholder or evasion delay.
## Result of the Action:
There is no visible activity on screen. However, logs will capture:

-The invocation of "powershell.exe"

-The "-EncodedCommand" parameter

-The use of hidden window mode (-WindowStyle Hidden)
## Why This Simulates Threat Activity
Real attackers often encode PowerShell commands avoid detection by traditional logging tools, hide malicious logic from basic review and execute in-memory attacks (fileless malware).
